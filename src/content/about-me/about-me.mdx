I'm Monica, a devoted enthusiast of travel, books, and fiber arts from Cincinnati, OH. My love for travel flourished in my youth as I journeyed between the Midwest and East Coast to visit my cherished Memaw and Baba. Being passionate about travel, they were eager to ensure that the spirit of adventure and storytelling was instilled in me. Amidst my Baba's cancer treatment, he organized a comprehensive family trip to Disney to nurture our love for exploration.

Tragically, disaster struck, and my Baba passed away before the trip. In his memory, my Memaw decided to take us, marking the beginning of my enduring love affair with Disney destinations. Going to Disney World with my family during this time of tragedy, the atmosphere and magic kept the joy my Baba gave me alive, and Disney has become a place of hope and positivity for me.

As an adult, my passion for travel was reignited when my father took me to Monterey, California, for my 18th birthday. There, I spent my time obsessively watching otters and reading books on the beach. Later, my boyfriend introduced me to the diverse flavors of Universal Studios (Iâ€™m a proud Ravenclaw, by the way). Today, I embark on regular journeys, with many leading me to the Happiest Place on Earth. There, I actively participate in RunDisney events, cultivate an appreciation for thrill rides, and indulge in some of the finest cuisine available.
